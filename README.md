## Custom display starter kit

The `custom-display-example.*` files demonstrate how to build a swipeable display that plugs into the host dashboard:

1. Open the app and tap **Upload Display Files**.
2. Select `custom-display-example.html`, `custom-display-example.css`, and `custom-display-example.js` together (they must share the same base name).
3. Swipe through the dashboard to find the new “Track Companion” screen; edit the files to experiment with your own layout.

The JavaScript example is heavily commented to help you listen for the `telemetry-update` event and render speed/acceleration/timer data. Use it as a boilerplate for client-mode experiments.
